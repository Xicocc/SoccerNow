# SoccerNow ‚öΩ

A full-stack application for managing players, teams, referees, matches, and competitions.  
Developed as a **university project** (**FCUL**), focusing on clean architecture, layered design, and multi-platform interaction.

The project delivers:
- A **Spring Boot backend** providing a REST API for data management.  
- A **JavaFX desktop client** and a **Thymeleaf-based web interface** for user interaction.  

My primary contributions centered on the **frontend** ‚Äî designing and implementing the JavaFX UI and the Thymeleaf web interface (layouts, controllers, styling, navigation). I also contributed to backend integration and endpoints, working in collaboration with my teammate, who primarily led the backend.

## üöÄ Project Overview

SoccerNow is composed of three main parts:

- **Backend (Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL)**  
  REST API for managing players, teams, matches, and competitions.  
  Uses Spring Data JPA, DTOs, layered architecture, and global exception handling.

- **Web Interface (Thymeleaf, CSS)**  
  Provides a browser-based UI to interact with backend data.  
  Built with reusable templates and entity-specific pages (`player.html`, `team.html`, etc.).

- **Desktop Interface (JavaFX, FXML)**  
  A native client for local data interaction.  
  Includes modular navigation, dedicated controllers, and automatic filtering in tables.

Developed by: Francisco Carvalho (fc52838) and Martim Neto (fc56279)

- **Francisco Carvalho (me):** Primary focus on the **frontend** (JavaFX + Thymeleaf Web UI), including reusable layouts, controllers, modular navigation, and styling. Also contributed to backend endpoints and integration.
- **Martim Neto:** Primary focus on the **backend** (Spring Boot API + data layer), including domain modeling, JPA repositories, DTOs, and error handling. Also contributed to frontend integration.

Some commits appear under university IDs due to GitLab classroom setup (e.g., fc56279@‚Ä¶).
